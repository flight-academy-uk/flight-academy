## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Architecture decision records

- ADR-001 through ADR-020 accepted, covering: platform choices, release & deployment, database & migrations, defence-in-depth, workspace & crate layout, API contract conventions, incremental sync & filtering, API data-sharing posture, event streams & audit scope, platform-operator (staff) cross-tenant access, user-consent grant flow (OAuth 2.1), cross-tenant DEK assignment & erasure-by-reference, auth keys & signing infrastructure, frontend architecture, CSP & static-build reconciliation, compliance baseline, outbound HTTP & SSRF posture, OpenAPI emission format (JSON over YAML), white-label runtime (brand-as-immutable-asset + sensitive-route preview, with aviation safety carve-outs), MASH frontend architecture (Maud + HTMX + Alpine + Tailwind on Axum; CloudFront edge with ACM wildcard cert + WAF; single Rust binary; aviation safety floor no-JS mandatory; supersedes ADR-014 SvelteKit).
- Living domain model reference at `docs/design/domain-model.md`; operations docs queue at `docs/operations/README.md`.

#### Backend — Rust workspace

- Initial Cargo workspace skeleton per ADR-005: `apps/api` binary; `flight-academy-core`, `flight-academy-auth`, `flight-academy-db`, `flight-academy-test-support` crates.
- Axum HTTP foundation: `/healthz` endpoint, code-first OpenAPI emission via `utoipa-axum`, `emit-spec` subcommand, problem+json error envelope (RFC 9457), `x-request-id` middleware (UUID v7).
- DB foundation: `sqlx` + embedded migrations, `Db` handle with `begin_tenant` (`SET LOCAL ROLE app_api` + `app.current_tenant` GUC), `migrate` subcommand.
- `audit_events` table per ADR-009: range-partitioned by month, INSERT-only at the SQL level (statement triggers — PG 17+ compatible), per-tenant + per-user + platform chain kinds, RLS isolating tenant chains from `app_api`.
- ABAC primitives per ADR-001 §C and ADR-010 §B: `Subject { user_id, actor_class, tenant_id, roles, attributes, elevation }`, `Action`, `Resource`, `Policy` trait, `Decision { Permit, Deny, NotApplicable }`. Concrete policies: `TenantOwnership` (baseline tenant-match gate), `TenantAdministration` (composes ownership + `Role::TenantAdmin`).
- Tenants resource: table with slug-addressing (regex-constrained, partial unique index where not deleted), `tenant_type` CHECK over `('ato','part_145','airfield_operator')`, soft-delete from day one (`deleted_at` + `deletion_reason` consistency CHECK), `(updated_at, id)` watermark index. `GET`/`PATCH`/`DELETE /api/v1/tenants/{slug}` endpoints, ABAC-gated, with atomic UPDATE-plus-audit in a single SERIALIZABLE transaction.
- Hash-chained audit writer per ADR-004 §H + ADR-009 §C: SHA-256 over RFC 8785 JCS canonical bytes (`occurred_at`, `actor_class`, `actor_id`, `tenant_id`, `chain_kind`, `chain_id`, `payload`) concatenated with `prev_hash`; SERIALIZABLE isolation + bounded retry on `SQLSTATE 40001`; `audit::payload_hash` re-derivation helper for verifiers; algorithm-agility via persisted constituent fields.
- Startup pool-role pre-flight (`Db::verify_audit_pool_role`): refuses to start `serve` if the pool's session role lacks `INSERT`/`SELECT` grant on `audit_events` or doesn't bypass RLS — closes the silent-chain-fork failure mode (RLS-subjected role would return empty `prev_hash` lookups, every row becoming a new "first" entry without surface).
- Baseline security headers (ADR-004 §F + OWASP additions): Content-Security-Policy (deny-everything for JSON), Strict-Transport-Security preload, X-Frame-Options DENY, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin, Permissions-Policy (sensors / camera / mic / geolocation / payment / USB denied), Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy same-origin, Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy same-origin, Cache-Control no-store. Emitted outermost via `entry().or_insert()` so future static-route handlers can supply their own per-surface CSP.

#### Web — MASH foundations (Maud + Axum + Tailwind)

- `maud = 0.27.0` (with the `axum` feature) added to `apps/api`. The MASH HTML surface lives in the same Rust binary as the JSON API per [ADR-020](docs/architecture/ADR-020-mash-frontend-architecture.md) §A.
- `apps/api/build.rs` runs `bun x @tailwindcss/cli` to compile `apps/api/styles/app.css` → `apps/api/static/app.css` on every `cargo build`. `apps/api/static/` is gitignored — build artefacts are reproduced from sources, not committed.
- `apps/api/package.json` declares a dev-only `@tailwindcss/cli 4.3.0` dependency; Bun manages installation. Bun is a build-time dependency; production runtime is Rust-only.
- First MASH HTML route: `GET /` returns a Maud-rendered landing page linking the Tailwind stylesheet. Plain Axum route — not in the OpenAPI contract per ADR-020 §A — merged into the `OpenApiRouter` so it shares the request-id propagation + security headers middleware stack (ADR-004 §B / §F).
- `/static/*` served by `tower_http::services::ServeDir` from `apps/api/static/`; resolves relative to the binary's cwd. Content-hashed asset URLs and the `embedded-static` cargo feature (rust-embed) land in subsequent slices.
- `apps/web-ui/tokens/` (`tokens.json` + JSON Schema + `tokens.css`) preserved as design source-of-truth; the `@theme` mapping into Tailwind lands alongside IBM Plex / `embedded-static`.
- Handlers tree follows ADR-020 §D per-resource layout: JSON-only resources stay flat (`audit_events.rs`, `health.rs`, `tenants.rs`); resources with HTML rendering become a subdirectory with `mod.rs` (controller — HTTP, CSP, response shaping) and `view.rs` (pure Maud template — no `axum`/HTTP types). The split makes templates unit-testable without spinning up the router.
- Vendored client bundles per ADR-020 §F — `apps/api/build.rs` copies distributed minified JS into `apps/api/static/vendor/`: HTMX 2.0.10 + the `sse` / `response-targets` / `preload` extensions, plus Alpine 3.15.12 via `@alpinejs/csp` (the CSP-safe build that drops `new Function()` so strict CSP needs neither `'unsafe-inline'` nor `'unsafe-eval'`). Pinned versions live in `apps/api/package.json`; `bun.lock` keeps the extracted bundles byte-identical across machines. Future Alpine components register via `Alpine.data('name', () => ({...}))` from external scripts rather than via inline `x-data` JS expressions.
- First end-to-end MASH demo: `GET /_hx/home/server-id` returns a Maud fragment with a freshly generated UUID v7; the landing page's button issues an HTMX `hx-get` against the endpoint and swaps the fragment into a slot. Proves the client→server→client roundtrip across the full stack (Maud render, Axum routing, HTMX swap).
- Landing-page CSP refined per ADR-020 §K: `default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'none'`. No `'unsafe-inline'`, no `'unsafe-eval'`. Tighter than ADR-015 §A's `default-src 'self'` baseline because the surface has no images / fonts / forms / frames; per-route relaxations land when a surface actually needs them.

#### CI / tooling

- `scripts/check-all.sh` orchestrates `cargo audit`, `cargo deny check`, `gitleaks dir`, `typos`, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `shellcheck`, `actionlint` — same set the CI workflows run.
- CI workflows: `CI` (Rust lint + test on PG 18 service + schema-drift check against committed `crates/flight-academy-db/schema.sql` per ADR-003 §E), `DCO` (inlined sign-off check), `OpenSSF Scorecard`, `CodeQL` (Rust static analysis — inter-procedural taint tracking; default suite covers SQL injection with `sqlx`/`postgres`/`tokio-postgres` modeling, path traversal, SSRF, XSS, weak crypto, cleartext logging, hard-coded secrets, etc.; `build-mode: none` skips Cargo compilation and bypasses `apps/api/build.rs`'s Bun dependency; runs weekly Wednesdays + on push/PR to `main`). All actions SHA-pinned with version-trailer comments. Both `lint` and `test` jobs in `CI` install Bun 1.3.1 before any cargo command — `apps/api/build.rs` invokes `@tailwindcss/cli` at compile time per ADR-020 §O. A dedicated Web CI workflow (CSS bundle size budget + Tailwind drift) lands with PR B.
- Integration test infrastructure: testcontainers-modules + tokio `OnceCell` PG container + `tokio::Mutex` migration lock; per-test fresh database; superuser pool so RLS is bypassed for seeds while tenant-scoped reads exercise the policy.
- `Dependabot` configured for `cargo`, GitHub Actions, and Docker (anticipated `deploy/docker/`). Patches grouped per ecosystem; majors come as separate PRs. Web npm watcher is re-added with the MASH foundations PR (Tailwind dev dep per ADR-020 §O).

#### Repository scaffolding (preserved from the original entry)

- Licence (AGPL-3.0), contribution policy, code of conduct, code of ethics (the seventy-two instruments), security policy, governance, code owners, changelog, editorconfig, gitignore, issue and pull request templates.

### Security

- All commits to `main` are GPG-signed and DCO sign-off'd (`git commit -s`); the DCO check is required on every PR.
- `cargo-deny` policy enforces AGPLv3-compatible licences and bans known-vulnerable advisories; `cargo audit` runs in CI; `gitleaks` scans the repo before every push.
- OpenSSF Scorecard workflow publishes the project's posture; protected branches enforce signed commits, linear history, and pull-request review.
